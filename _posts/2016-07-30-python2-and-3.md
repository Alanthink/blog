## Overall review of Python2 in OSX

In the newest osx operation EI Capitan, python2 is pre-installed in the system in `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions`. Take python2.7 for example. The path for python packages imported is `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python`. As `/System` is under protection via SIP(System Integrity Protection), you can **NOT** make any changes in that folder.  When you run 

```shell
$ sudo pip install $(package_path)
```

in Terminal, the package is installed in `/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages` which can not be searched by  `import`. In my last post [install tensorflow on ei capitan](/blog/cs/install-tensorflow-on-ei-capitan/) I disabled SIP to solve this problem.

## Install Python3

With pip3, it is easy to install python3.

```shell
$ sudo pip3 install python
```

Here, python is installed in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions` without prefix `/System`. And when you install a package using the following script:

```shell
$ sudo pip install $(package_path)
```

This package is installed in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages`.

## Running

Type `python` and `python3` to run python2 and python3 respectively.

## Install Jupyter 

After installing jupyter via pip3, when you run `jupyter notebook`. Python3 kernel is not an option. To solve this problem, it is enough to run the following scripts in Terminal:

```shell
$ cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin
$ sudo ./ipython kernelspec install-self
```
