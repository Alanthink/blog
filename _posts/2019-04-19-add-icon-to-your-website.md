To make a website more beautiful, you may want to add an icon to the website like the following:

![alt text](../../images/icon_example.png)

After googling, you may find it simple by just trying to put the following html script inside the head body (i.e., `<head> </head>`) of the websites :

```html
<!-- Favicon head tag -->
<link rel="icon" href="/blog/XXX.ico" type="image/x-icon">
```

One thing is that you should avoid naming the icon `favicon.ico`, otherwise the icon will not show.
